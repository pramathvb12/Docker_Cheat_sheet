Docker Notes ...

Use of virtual machines is to test the projects with different versions of packages hey use. Virtual machines use hypervisor to run both os , example like vmware,virtualbox,hyperv(only windows).

Use of vm require divide of resources in the host system. This may slow down system, require more computations. and also require installation of each os files(iso).


So inorder to solve this docker came , where every project will be in a container if user do not want then he can erase it without harming the host os. This starts quickly because runs on liscensed  os .

Docker architecture - 

client-server.. , client uses rest apis to server docker.Special kinds of processes.It shares the kernel of host os.
